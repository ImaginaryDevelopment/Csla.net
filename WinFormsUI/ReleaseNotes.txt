Please note that in the App.Config, the 'production' server section is enabled by default.  Simply remark this out:
<add key ="CslaDataPortalUrl" value ="http://projectreportwcf.mpccservice.com/WCFPortal.svc"/>
and uncomment this:
 <!--<add key ="CslaDataPortalUrl" value ="http://localhost:2185/WCFPortal.svc"/>-->
 to switch back to the local dev version.  You will have to attach the db file to your local sqlexpress instance.  Remember to delete and readd the 
 'AppUser' account so it is your local one.  Otherwise you will get database login failures.  Enjoy!
